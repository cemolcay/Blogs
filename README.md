# Blogs

I'll host my blog posts in this repo, in markdown format. Will use the issues as my todo list and accept post recommendations, or even pull requests to corrections and stuff. So hopefully, it would be an experimental open-sourced blogging thing.  
I'm considering writing in English and Turkish which is my main language and hard to find quality content about Swift and iOS.  
Also, I'm going to write about AudioKit, using MIDI, audio synthesis and some of my favourite open-source frameworks.  
I guess, I'm gonna publish these posts on Medium for now, but will consider creating a github pages with jekyll to host them here, in the future. Any ideas would be apperciated.
